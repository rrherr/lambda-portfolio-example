Hi, I'm Jane Smith, a data scientist focused on helping professional service firms and tech startups understand their customers and recommend the right decisions. To do this, I specialize in recommender systems, natural language processing, and deploying machine learning models with user interfaces.

Studying astrophysics taught me to analyze big data. Growing up with lawyers taught me to ask hard questions. I'd love to work with you to solve business problems using math and code.

### Recommenders
I've learned techniques for the "cold start" problem â€” making recommendations for new users without much information. Offline, salespeople build rapport, but online, how can we learn quickly? To explore this, I developed a beer recommender app that learns your taste in just 10 questions. I gained experience with collaborative filtering and content-based approaches, using Python's scikit-learn and Surprise libraries.

### Natural Language Processing
I'm experienced scraping, processing, and analyzing unstructured text data with Python, including NLTK and spaCy.

### Deploying models
I prototype in Jupyter Notebook, with pandas to wrangle, matplotlib to visualize, and scikit-learn to model. Then I deploy interactive web apps to make models useful. I use Plotly Dash, a framework built on React, D3, and Flask.

### Physics
Growing up I idolized Einstein, so I studied physics. Now I'm excited to apply these skills to new, practical problems. Physics backgrounds are common for data scientists.

### Law
Both my parents were lawyers, so I'm comfortable around legalese. Whatever your industry, I can learn the language and help translate business problems into data science solutions.
